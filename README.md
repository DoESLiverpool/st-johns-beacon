A large scale 3D printable model of St John's Beacon (The Radio City Tower) in Liverpool. Intended to be printed on 
an Ultimaker 2 Extended, and take full advantage of the 30cm print height, to give a tower approximately 1m tall. 

Blank faced letter blocks around the circumfrence allow LEDs inside the cupola to light the letters for display from 
an Arduino inside.
